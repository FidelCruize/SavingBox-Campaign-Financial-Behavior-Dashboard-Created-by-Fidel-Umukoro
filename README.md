## üßº Excel Data Cleaning

The dataset was cleaned in Excel before loading into Power BI. Key preprocessing steps:

1. **Fill missing demographic fields:**

```excel
=IF(A2="", "Unknown", A2)

üß† Power BI Data Modeling
Fact and dimension tables were connected using the following relationships:

users[User_id] ‚Üí savings[User_id], campaign_participation[User_id], loans[User_id]

savings[Date], activity_log[Timestamp] ‚Üí DateTable[Date]

Date Table (DAX):

DAX
Copy
Edit
DateTable = 
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(MIN(savings[Date]), MAX(savings[Date])),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month", FORMAT([Date], "MMMM"),
    "MonthNumber", MONTH([Date]),
    "Week", WEEKNUM([Date]),
    "Day", FORMAT([Date], "dddd")
)
üßÆ Key DAX Measures
üü¢ Engagement Metrics
Active Users:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Active Users = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(activity_log[User_id]),
    FILTER(activity_log, activity_log[Activity_type] = "login")
)
Monthly Active Users (MAU):

DAX
Copy
Edit
MAU = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(activity_log[User_id]),
    ALLEXCEPT(DateTable, DateTable[Month], DateTable[Year])
)
üéØ Campaign Metrics
Conversion Rate:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Campaign Conversion = 
DIVIDE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(campaign_participation[User_id]),
    DISTINCTCOUNT(users[User_id])
)
Female Participation:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Participants (Female) = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(campaign_participation),
    users[Gender] = "Female"
)
üí∞ Savings Insights
Avg Savings Per User:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Avg Savings Per User = 
AVERAGEX(
    SUMMARIZE(savings, savings[User_id], "Total", SUM(savings[Amount])),
    [Total]
)
Consistent Savers (3+ months):

DAX
Copy
Edit
Consistent Savers = 
COUNTROWS(
    FILTER(
        SUMMARIZE(savings, savings[User_id], "MonthCount", DISTINCTCOUNT(savings[Month])),
        [MonthCount] >= 3
    )
)
Savings Segment Logic:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Savings Segment = 
SWITCH(TRUE(),
    [Save Count] >= 10, "Power Saver",
    [Save Count] >= 3, "Casual Saver",
    "Low Activity"
)
üí≥ Loan Analysis
Default Rate:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Loan Default Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(loans), loans[Loan_Status] = "Defaulted"),
    COUNTROWS(loans)
)
Avg Loan (Completed):

DAX
Copy
Edit
Avg Loan (Completed) = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(loans[Loan_Amount]),
    loans[Loan_Status] = "Completed"
)
